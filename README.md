# Node-Farm
A web API built using Node.js.
In this project, I created a web API using Node.js on the backend. The frontend is built using HTML templates. The user can request and view details about farm produce that we're offering on our fictional Node Farm.
The data is contained in the data.json file.
I've attached a screenshot of the app.

Getting started: 
If you don't already have Node installed, follow the instructions on https://nodejs.org/en/.
Dependencies: This project uses a simple dependency called 'Slugify' which is a package that's used to make readable urls out of names e.g. the product names in this project.
Run 'npm install slugify'. Then, run 'npm start' to start up the app. Navigate to localhost:3000 on your browser to see and use the app.

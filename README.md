# Node-Farm
A web API built using Node.js.
In this project, I created a web API using Node.js on the backend. The user can see data about a fictional farm. They can request and view details about farm produce that we're offering on our Node Farm.
The data is contained in the data.json file.

Getting started
If you don't already have Node installed, follow the instructions on Node.js

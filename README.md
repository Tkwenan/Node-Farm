# Node-Farm
A web API built using Node.js.
In this project, I created a web API using Node.js on the backend. The frontend is built using HTML templates. The user can request and view details about farm produce that we're offering on our fictional Node Farm.
The data is contained in the data.json file.
I've attached a screenshot of the app.

Getting started
If you don't already have Node installed, follow the instructions on https://nodejs.org/en/.
Dependencies: This project uses a simple dependency called 'Slugify' which is a package that's used to make readable urls out of names e.g. the 
project folder and type 'npm install slugify'
and type 'npm start' to start up the app. Navigate to localhost:3000 on your browser to see and use the app.
